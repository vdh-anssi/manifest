# About the WooKey project manifests hierarchy

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/phil0093/phil/_apis/build/status/wookey-project.manifest?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/phil0093/phil/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)


The WooKey project hierarchy is separated into two main components:

   * Software components
   * Hardware components


The software components manifests are stored in the soft/ directory.
They permit to download the overall SDK for the various WooKey targets
(i.e. firmware profiles, on a given board).

The hardware components manifests are stored in the hard/ directory.
They permit to download the hardware designs.
